# Opsbox Plugins
Welcome to the Opsbox plugins directory. This repository contains a collection of plugins designed to extend the functionality of Opsbox. Each plugin is defined in its own `pyproject.toml` file, which specifies the dependencies required for that plugin.

## Installing Plugins
### Through PyPI

This document outlines how to install Opsbox **[checks](#1-checks)** (for different services) and **[outputs](#2-outputs)** (for various integrations).

## 1. Checks

Opsbox checks let you verify and monitor specific AWS services such as S3, RDS, ELB, EC2, etc. When you install the checks, Opsbox will also install the provider for the service.

### Installation

  ```bash
  uv add opsbox-<service_name>-checks
  ```

### Examples
- **Installing S3 checks (pip)**:
  ```bash
  pip install opsbox-s3-checks

  ```bash
  uv add opsbox-elb-checks
  ```

- **Installing Route 53 checks (pip)**:
  ```bash
  pip install opsbox-r53-checks

  Note: Even though the service is called Route 53, use r53 in the package name.

## 2. Outputs

### Sync UV environment
To begin, we first need to have a good testing/build environment.

In the root of the git directory, run `uv sync`. This will install everything needed.

### Run build.py
Next, run the bulk build script using `uv run build.py`

### Enjoy!
The build script will copy all the distributions to the root /dist folder.

Enjoy your distributions!

## Using Plugins with Opsbox

### Packages
Packages are autodetected by opsbox if they are in the same environment.

### Individual Modules
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies for the plugins in OpsBox's , you can point the main Opsbox program to this directory using the `--plugin_dir` option. Ensure you have installed the prerequisites for Opsbox before proceeding.

```sh
main.py ... --plugin_dir path/to/this/repository
